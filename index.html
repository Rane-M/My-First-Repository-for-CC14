                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the web application development course, I
                            expect to learn the basics of how websites
                            and web apps are built using tools like HTML,
                            CSS, JavaScript, and backend frameworks like
                            Node.js or Django.</li>
                        <li>My goal is to go beyond
                            just making simple web pages and learn how
                            to create complete web applications that are
                            functional and can be used in real-life
                            situations.</li>
                        <li>I also hope to gain hands-on
                            experience by working on projects that allow
                            me to put what I learn into practice. Along
                            with this, I want to improve my problemsolving skills, especially when dealing with
                            bugs or issues in code.</li>
                        <li>By the end of the
                            course, I want to feel confident in my ability
                            to build secure and efficient web applications
                            and be prepared for a career in tech.</li>
